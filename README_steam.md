[b]Zeus Additions[/b] adds a handful of modules to the Zeus interface. Requires ZEN and ACE. This mod is a client side mod.

[h2]JIP feature[/h2]

Only 1 client needs it to be enabled for it to be added to the server. If multiple clients have Zeus Additions, one or more have it turned on but the others not, the latter can still set JIP features in modules.
